-- General
For instructions and a list of features, please visit the official mod page:

Before using the mod, it is recommended to use ONE tech script files found in /WEdit/tech/ to lessen the possibilities of conflicts. You need to have the specific tech active on your character for the mod to work.
If you want to use WEdit with your own scripts, you have to require one of the scripts located in /WEdit/scripts/.

-- Automatically loads and injects the WEdit controller; which handles and binds the WEdit items to their corresponding function and displays additional information.
-- This internally loads the core "/scripts/wedit.lua" file, so there's no need for another require statement.
require "/scripts/weditController.lua" 

-- Core WEdit library. Allows direct function calls, which means you'll have to write your own code to interact with it.
-- Unless you're a modder, it is not recommended to use this one.
require "/scripts/wedit.lua"
