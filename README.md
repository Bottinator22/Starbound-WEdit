## Features

* Edit terrain in-game on a large scale.
* Copy and paste structures, even between planets.
* Many [tools](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/wiki/Features) accessible from a [compact interface](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/wiki/Compact-Interface).
* Configure settings in a Quickbar interface.

A full list of features with their usage can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/wiki).

## Wiki

The Wiki covers just about everything you need to know and do to use WEdit.

## Planned

See the [Issues page](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/labels/enhancement). You can post your own suggestions here too!

## Potential Issues

* Blocks can not be placed directly in front of or behind empty space, when there are no adjacent blocks on the same layer. Some actions may not yield the result you expected initially because of this. The script tries to work around this issue by running the same actions multiple times.
* Server lag can cause synchronization issues; the script continues working while the world hasn't updated yet. You can compensate by slowing down WEdit in the [settings](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/wiki/Settings-Interface).
* The Undo Tool should not be relied upon; it's probably pretty buggy. It is recommended to **back up worlds** before making any major changes!
