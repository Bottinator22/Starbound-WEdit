## Planned
No additional features planned yet. Feel free to suggest them [on the discussion page](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/wedit.116953/)!

## Potential Issues
* Blocks can not be placed directly in front of or behind empty space, when there are no adjacent blocks on the same layer. Some actions may not yield the result you expected initially because of this. The script tries to work around this issue by running the same actions multiple times.
* Server lag can cause synchronization issues; the script continues working while the world hasn't updated yet.
* Undo Tool should not be completely relied upon; it's probably pretty buggy. It is recommended to back up worlds before making any major changes.
