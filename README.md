## Installation
* [Download](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/releases) the release for the current version of Starbound.
* Place the `WEdit.modpak` file in your mods folder (eg. `D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\mods\`). Overwrite the existing file if necessary.
* Activate the `dash` tech on your character.
 * In singleplayer, use `/enabletech dash` and `/spawnitem techconsole` with your cursor pointed near your character. Place the tech console down and activate the tech from the tech console.

## Usage
*It is recommended to have `/debug` on at all times when using WEdit. Although WEdit will function fine without enabling the debug mode, vital information can only be seen with this mode enabled.*

To use any of the features WEdit offers, you must first obtain all WEdit Tools. You can obtain them by running the below command in singleplayer, and using the item.
Note that this will add 13 items to your tools/etc. tab in your inventory. If there's not enough space in your inventory, the items will be dropped on the ground at the position of your character.
```
/spawnitem silverore 1 '{"itemTags":[], "radioMessagesOnPickup":[], "learnBlueprintsOnPickup":[], "twoHanded":true, "shortdescription":"WE_ItemBox", "category":"^orange;WEdit: Item Box", "description":"^yellow;^yellow;Primary Fire: Spawn Tools.^reset;", "inventoryIcon":"/objects/floran/chestfloran1/chestfloran1icon.png"}'
```
By holding one of these tools, you can access the corresponding feature. The usage of each feature is described in the below section [Features](#features). Generally, the left and right mouse buttons (primary fire and alt fire) are used to activate the items.

You can toggle the built-in noclip mode by pressing your second tech action key (`G` by default).
